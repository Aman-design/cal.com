# Contributing to the App Store

Since Cal.com is open source we encourage developers to create new apps for others to use. This guide is to help you get started.

## Structure

All apps can be found under `packages/app-store`. In this folder is `_example` which shows the general structure of an app.

```sh
├──_example
|
|   ├──api
|   |   ├──example.ts
|   |   ├──index.ts
|
|   ├──components
|   |   ├──InstallAppButton.tsx
|   |   ├──index.ts
|
|   ├──lib
|   |   ├──adaptor.ts
|   |   ├──index.ts
|
|   ├──static
|   |   ├──icon.svg
|
|   ├──index.ts
|   ├──package.json
|   ├──.env.example
|	├──README.mdx
```

## Getting Started

In the `package.json` name your package appropriately and list the dependencies needed for the package.

Next in the `.env.example` specify the environmental variables (ex. auth token, API secrets) that your app will need. In a comment add a link to instructions on how to obtain the credentials. Create a `.env` with your the filled in environmental variables.

In `index.js` fill out the meta data that will be rendered on the app page. Under `packages/app-store/index.ts`, import your app and add it under `appStore`. Your app should now appear in the app store.

Under the `/api` folder, this is where any API calls that are associated with your app will be handled. Since cal.com uses Next.js we use dynamic API routes. In this example if we want to hit `/api/example.ts` the route would be `{BASE_URL}/api/integrations/_example/example`. Export your endpoints in an `index.ts` file under `/api` folder and import them in your main `index.ts` file.

Under the `/components` folder, this is where the install button for your app should live. Follow the template under `_example` to add your on click action (ex. Redirecting to a log in page or opening a modal).

The `/lib` folder is where the functions of your app live. For example, when creating a booking with a MS Teams link the function to make the call to grab the link lives in the `/lib` folder. Export your endpoints in an `index.ts` file under `/lib` folder and import them in your main `index.ts` file.

On the app store page you can customize your apps description by adding a markdown file called `README.mdx`. If you do not add one then the description from you `package.json` will be used instead.

The `/static` folder is where you can store your app icon and any images that your `README.mdx` may use.

## Adding Your App to the App Store
To render your app on the app store page, go to `packages/app-store/index.ts`. Import your app into the file and add it to the `appStore` object.

Under `packages/app-store/components.tsx`,  in the `InstallAppButtonMap` object dynamically import your install button. Your install button should live under `{your_app}/components`.
