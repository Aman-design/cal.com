# Slack

## Connecting 
Connecting the bot is easy - If you are a workspace admin, the install button will add the bot to the workspace and also authorize your account with the bot. If you are a normal user, the install button will connect your Slack account with Cal.com. This will allow you to perform commands in Slack.

## Commands
`/today` - This command will display all meetings you have in your Cal.com profile for the current day. This will send a hidden message (not visible to anyone other than you) to the channel you issued the command in.

`/create-event` - It will display a modal allowing you to simply create a meeting invite with anyone in Slack. Success/Error information will be displayed in a private direct message from the bot.

`/links` - This command will post all your Cal.com meeting links into the current Slack channel you are in. **Note**: The bot needs to have permission to talk in the channel you are sending the message in. Otherwise, you won't be able to send your links. 

As this is the beggining stage of our Slack integration, we plan on adding more commands in the future that will further improve your Cal.com experience.
